# Teleop

## Keyboards

### Teleop Twist Keyboard

{% embed url="https://github.com/ros2/teleop\_twist\_keyboard" %}

This was forked from the[ teleop\_tools package](https://index.ros.org/r/teleop_tools/) and is the in ROS2 repo but doesnâ€™t have foxy branch and less recently updated  

It has a release so can installed via apt-get install ros-foxy-teleop-twis-keyboard 

To Run  `ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard`

This sends a twist message.

Has more keys mapped than other option, inc speed control. 

### Teleop Tools key\_teleop

{% embed url="https://index.ros.org/r/teleop\_tools/" %}

This has a recently updated foxy branch.

Requires git clone install. 

Includes keyboard, mouse and joystick options.

The mouse one works but the keyboard one gives error as no qos setting used. Easy fix and I submitted a pull request to fix it.

```text
ros2 run key_teleop key_teleop
ros2 run mouse_teleop mouse_teleop
```

But...It only uses the arrow keys and no speed control so the other package is better on keys. Mouse maybe useful but feels a bit harder to precisely control. 

## Joysticks

Searching ros index reveals 3 options

1. [Teleop\_twist\_joy](https://index.ros.org/p/teleop_twist_joy/github-ros2-teleop_twist_joy/#foxy)
2. [Joy teleop from Teleop tools](https://index.ros.org/p/joy_teleop/github-pal-robotics-joy_teleop/#foxy)
3. [joy](https://index.ros.org/p/joy/github-ros-drivers-joystick_drivers/#foxy) from joystick\_drivers package

### 1. Teleop Twist Joy

The teleop\_node republishes Joy messages as scaled [geometry\_msgs/Twist](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Twist.html) messages.

So doesn't read the joystick itself \(use _joy_ for that\) but translates the raw buttons to a message type which is often used to describe robot motion so plug into a further controller node \(eg used in Husky\).

This has an xbox config file, but need to work out how to run it using that!

No ROS2 Documentation, but is for ROS1 which should be similar: [http://wiki.ros.org/teleop\_twist\_joy](http://wiki.ros.org/teleop_twist_joy)

```text
ros2 run teleop_twist_joy teleop_node 
```

###  2. Teleop Tools joy\_teleop

```text
ros2 run joy_teleop joy_teleop
```

### 3. Joy

> The joy package contains joy\_node, a node that interfaces a generic joystick to ROS 2. This node publishes a "Joy" message, which contains the current state of each one of the joystick's buttons and axes.

This package publishes all of the joystick buttons.
