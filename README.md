## ROS2 Cheat Sheets

Notes created while learning ROS2, intended for personal reference but made public in case they are useful to others

**To read on GitBook \(better formatted + navigation\) go** [**here**](https://n-fry.gitbook.io/ros2-notes/)\*\*\*\*

## Table of contents

* [ROS2 Basics](ros2-basics.md)
* [Installing Packages](installing-packages.md)

* [Run on Multiple Machines](run-on-multiple-platforms.md)

Pages added here when they are complete \(ish\).

## Sources

Most of this content is taken from other sources which have been acknowledged. This is not a repository of information from someone who knows what they are doing with ROS2\(!\), rather it is an amalgamation of information I have discovered from other people or trial and error and don't want to forget.

## Contribution

This is starting off as a record of what I have learnt but if you find any errors or have any helpful things to add then you can collaborate using [GitHub](https://github.com/nfry321/ROS2_cheat_sheets/).
